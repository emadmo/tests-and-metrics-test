     ##############################

Welcome to my solution sk_metric library
I hope you like it !
I developed and tested on a Mac OS , but it should be the same for linux . 
This was not tested on windows and the make file will not work with windows as compiler is only set to gcc!

The library comes with sk_test library which tests the sk_metric
sk_test takes the following parameters :

`-H "Header-name: Header-value"`: can be used multiple times, each time specifying an extra HTTP header to add to your request
`-n <integer>`  number of HTTP requests to make . Has to be bigger than 0
`-v`            Verbose enable , Enables detailed prints about the HTTP requests


Requirments : 
=============
To be able to build you need the following :
- Linux or Mac OS (make file does not support windows)
- gcc
- curl library

Building steps:
===============

make

Cleaning the build :
====================
make clean

Notes:
======

- By default the logs are enabled for the sk_metric lib . To disable Logs : 

	comment out this line in the makefile :
	CFLAGS+=-DSK_METRIC_LOG

- You can use test target to test the library

make test

Thanks !
